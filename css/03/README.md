# Version 3

This one is based on the latest [Brittany Chiang's website](https://brittanychiang.com/)

It's not a source copy paste situation. I'm going to try to replicate the same effect (the best I can).
She used Tailwind CSS and Next.js for her website. I'll be using plain CSS and JS and see how close I can get.

## Approach

I retain the other elements of the previous design, and modify one element at a time. Starting with the navbar which is now a sticky sidebar.
